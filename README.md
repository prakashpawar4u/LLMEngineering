# LLMEngineering


🚀 LLM Engineering

A hands-on repository for Large Language Model (LLM) Engineering, covering end-to-end concepts, implementations, and real-world applications.

This repo is designed for practitioners and learners who want to build, fine-tune, and deploy LLMs with a strong focus on practical coding, frameworks, and use-cases.

📌 Features

📖 Fundamentals of LLMs and Transformer architecture

🔧 Fine-tuning & prompt engineering examples

🛠️ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines

🌐 LLMOps (deployment, monitoring, scaling)

🤖 Agentic AI workflows using LangChain / LangGraph

🧩 Custom utilities for dataset preparation and evaluation

📊 Experiment tracking with MLflow / Weights & Biases
